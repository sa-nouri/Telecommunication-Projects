## Project Categories

### Wireless Communication
- **Gaussian Wiretap Channel**: Implementation and analysis of Gaussian wiretap channel models, including mutual information and bit error rate calculations.

### Digital Communication
- **Digital Communication Labs**: MATLAB implementations for various digital communication concepts and laboratory exercises.

### Network Optimization
- **Resource Allocation**: Multi-knapsack problem implementation for resource allocation optimization.
- **Traffic Classification**: Dataset processing and analysis for network traffic classification.
- **Agent Prediction**: Monte Carlo algorithm implementation for activity detection and prediction.

### Security
- **Authentication WPL**: Wireless physical layer authentication implementations using MATLAB and USRP hardware.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Each project should have its own README.md with specific setup and usage instructions
   - Keep related files together in project-specific directories
   - Use consistent naming conventions within each project

2. **Documentation**:
   - Include clear comments in code
   - Document dependencies and requirements
   - Provide example usage where applicable

3. **Version Control**:
   - Use atomic commits for each logical change
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Keep the repository clean and organized
