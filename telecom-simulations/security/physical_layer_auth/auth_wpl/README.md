# Physical Layer Authentication (WPL)

## Description
MATLAB scripts and Simulink models for wireless physical layer authentication, including carrier frequency offset estimation and receiver implementations.

## Scripts
- `carrier_frequency_offset.m`
- `cfo_capturing.m`
- `htfe.m`
- `receiver.m`
- `sdr_receiver.m`
- `sdru_receiver.m`
- `usrp_receiving.m`
- `lab_1.m`
- `run_wlan_nonht_receiver.m`
- `fff.slx`: Simulink model

## Setup
- MATLAB R2018b or newer
- Communications Toolbox
- Simulink (for `.slx` files)
- USRP hardware (for hardware-related scripts)

## Usage
Open the desired `.m` file in MATLAB and run it. For Simulink models, open and simulate in Simulink. Hardware scripts require USRP hardware and proper configuration.

## Results
Scripts and models output plots, metrics, and receiver performance results.

## Data
- No external datasets required; all data is generated by the scripts
