# Gaussian Wiretap Channel

## Description
Implements and analyzes the Gaussian wiretap channel, focusing on mutual information and bit error rate (BER) calculations. Includes Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for simulation and analysis.

## Scripts
- `gaussian_wiretap_channel.py`: Main simulation script
- `mi_ber_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for MI and BER analysis

## Setup
- Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
- (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

## Dependencies
Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage
- Run the main simulation:
  ```bash
  python gaussian_wiretap_channel.py
  ```
- Open and run the notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook mi_ber_analysis.ipynb
  ```

## Results
Outputs plots and metrics for mutual information and BER under various channel conditions.

## Data
- No external datasets are required; all data is generated by the scripts.
