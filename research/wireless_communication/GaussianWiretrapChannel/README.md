# Gaussian Wiretap Channel

## Description
This project implements and analyzes the Gaussian wiretap channel, focusing on mutual information and bit error rate (BER) calculations. It includes both Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for simulation and analysis.

## Setup
- Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
- (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

## Dependencies
Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage
- Run the main simulation:
  ```bash
  python Gaussian_Wiretrap_Channel.py
  ```
- Open and run the notebook for analysis:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook MI_BER.ipynb
  ```

## Results
- The script and notebook output plots and metrics for mutual information and BER under various channel conditions.

## Data
- No external datasets are required; all data is generated by the scripts.
