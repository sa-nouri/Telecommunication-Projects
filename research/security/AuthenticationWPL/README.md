# AuthenticationWPL: Wireless Physical Layer Authentication

## Description
This project contains MATLAB scripts and Simulink models for wireless physical layer authentication, including carrier frequency offset estimation and receiver implementations.

## Setup
- MATLAB R2018b or newer
- Communications Toolbox
- Simulink (for `.slx` files)
- USRP hardware (for hardware-related scripts)

## Files
- `.m` files: MATLAB scripts for various authentication and receiver tasks
- `fff.slx`: Simulink model

## Usage
- Open the desired `.m` file in MATLAB and run it
- For Simulink models, open and simulate in Simulink
- Hardware scripts require USRP hardware and proper configuration

## Results
- Scripts and models output plots, metrics, and receiver performance results

## Data
- No external datasets required; all data is generated by the scripts
